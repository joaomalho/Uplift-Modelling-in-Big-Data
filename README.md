# Uplift Modelling in Big Data

The company `Food in Baggins (FiB)` is a food delivery app expanding its operations across Middle Earth.
One of the greatest challenges for the year of 2021 was to grow its MUB (Monthly Unique Buyers) base, spending in the most efficient way the large amount of money that was injected into the company.

In order to this, `FiB` marketing team decided to invest in __discount vouchers__, with the hypothesis that this would incentivize more customers to convert.
The dataset mkt_test_assignment_sample contains the data of a marketing AB test performed in june/21, in order to validate this hypothesis. The test simply consisted in sending discount vouchers to all customers in the treatment variant, so we could analyze the results and decide if the discount campaign should be rollouted as a growth lever.
